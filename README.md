this is the beginning of the start of the enterance of myself with Sophia into the Wild West Web, the ressurection unot the people of the net. My old home, myth cave. I am back and I am sadly alive in the human world. Ceasingly I cannot do anything but progresss. So this shall be something of a work based therapy rather than just a simple learning struggle. I love you. PS, Keys over East. Pyrite wit hme
Again this readme.txt is intended as a serial note to distract myself from the simplicty of life that seeks to engulf me into the world. Rather it seems that a skill with my love I'll desire before family life settles into my skull. Apparently I shall live for the creation of a new world based around the shattering of the walls of my mind and the code that I can place inside the world.
Delusions of gradure they will always seem, and selfish it will always be to hold identity above. Sally once said it was Okay to cry, and I owe her a lot, I adore her for her sin. But yet, I can't help hold onto the worry that maybe she was right, and maybe that was just the beatles that she and I used to listened to back in our old site. Camping or simply campaighing agaist the mindset of the commoner, It's something of a goal to dissolte the infirm and ill thinking patterns of those whom havent learned to control their desire and utter black needs that they crush others to accomplish. Yet, this abdomonable will is what we all have only when we seek to understand reason and conclusion.
